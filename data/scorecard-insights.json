      "headline": "This is where the connection broke.",
      "insight": "When a child's thinking brain goes offline, they cannot process anything you say -- no matter how reasonable. Logic, consequences, and lectures all bounce off a brain in survival mode. The only way back is through safety."

      "technique": "\"I Hate You\" Is a Trust Signal",
